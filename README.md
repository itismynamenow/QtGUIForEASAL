# QtGUIForEASAL
GUI for EASAL software made with Qt and OpenGL

EASAL is molecular modeling software located at https://bitbucket.org/geoplexity/easal.
Code in this repo represents work I did to create new GUI for EASAL with Qt and modern OpenGL. 
This is copy of currently closed repo with new GUI. I moved it here to have it as part of my portfolio.
